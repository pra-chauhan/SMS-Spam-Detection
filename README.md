# 📱 SMS Spam Detection 🚨
# Unmask Spam Messages with Data Visualization & Machine Learning!

# 🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to SMS Spam Detection Visualizations!
This project dives deep into the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from the UCI ML Repository. With over 5,569 messages labeled as Spam or Ham, we uncover patterns using powerful data visualization techniques and train a machine learning model to classify messages.

# 🔍 What You'll Discover:
✅ Spam vs Ham Ratio – How much spam are we really dealing with?
✅ Message Length Patterns – Are spam messages shorter or longer?
✅ Word Frequency in Spam – Which words scream "SPAM"?
✅ Top TF-IDF Keywords – The most influential words in spam messages.

# 🧩 Key Visualizations
📊 Pie Chart – Spam vs Ham distribution.
📈 Length Distribution Graph – Compare message lengths.
☁️ Word Cloud – Most frequent spam words.
🔑 TF-IDF Analysis – Significant keywords for spam detection.
